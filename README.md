### Hi, I am Ian 👋

I am an undergraduate student at Northeastern University studying Bioengineering and Artificial Intelligence. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on bringing research manuscript onto the blockchain
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about n-grams and [the General Index](https://archive.org/details/GeneralIndex)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on all things Open Science!

Outside of coding projects --see below-- I work as a biotechnology researcher at [Factor Bioscience](https://factor.bio/), photograph the streets and city of Boston ([check out my portfolio!](https://ianhay.net/)), and read extensively.
