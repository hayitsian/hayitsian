### Hi, I am Ian ðŸ‘‹

I am an undergraduate student at Northeastern University studying Bioengineering and Artificial Intelligence. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on bringing research manuscript onto the blockchain
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about efficient plagiarism web crawlers
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate

Outside of coding, I work as a biotechnology researcher at [Factor Bioscience](https://factor.bio/), photograph the streets and city of Boston ([check out my portfolio!](https://ianhay.net/)), and read extensively (always looking for book recommendations!).
