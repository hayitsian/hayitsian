### Hey, my name is Ian ðŸ‘‹

I am an undergraduate student at Northeastern University, where I study Bioengineering and Artificial Intelligence. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on visualizing scientific publication in the General Index Visualization repository.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about n-grams and [the General Index](https://archive.org/details/GeneralIndex), as well as Network Theory.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on all things Open Science!

Outside of coding projects --see below-- I work as a biotechnology researcher at [Factor Bioscience](https://factor.bio/), photograph the city of Boston ([check out my portfolio!](https://ianhay.net/)), and read extensively.
